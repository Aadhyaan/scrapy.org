    <p>We're about to release <a
    href="http://dev.scrapy.org/milestone/0.7">Scrapy 0.7</a>, the first
    stable release. However, the <a href="/doc/">documented API</a> can be
    considered quite stable.</p>

    more than one thousand retailer sites daily. For more information see the
    list of <a href="http://dev.scrapy.org/wiki/CompaniesUsingScrapy">Companies
